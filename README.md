1. Concurrency: Go is built with concurrency in mind and provides several features to
make it easy to write concurrent code.
    a. It's the idea that different tasks can be performed independently and
    simultaneously.
    b. Each task doesn't wait for the other to finish before starting their work.

2. Garbage collection: Go includes a garbage collector that automatically manages
memory, making it easier for developers to write code without having to worry about
memory management.

3. Static typing: Go is a statically typed language, which means that variables are
explicitly declared with a specific type and the type of a variable cannot be changed
during its lifetime. This can help catch errors at compile time and improve the overall
reliability of the code.

4. Lightweight: Goroutines takes only 8 kilobytes and yoou can have thousand of them.

5. Fast compilation: Go has a fast compiler that can quickly build large programs,making it suitable for building scalable applications.

6. Zero dependencies: Since the language does not rely on any external libraries or
frameworks, you do not need to worry about installing those dependencies on the
target machine. This can simplify the deployment process and reduce the risk of issues
caused by missing or incompatible dependencies. This can be particularly useful for
building applications that need to be deployed in a variety of different environments.

7. Built-in support for testing: Go includes built-in support for writing and running tests,
making it easy to test and verify code.

8. Strong community: Go has a strong and active community of developers who
contribute to the language and its Ecosystem, including libraries and tools

** Overall Go is versatile and powerful programming language that can be used
in a wide range of projects. Whether youâ€™re building a web application, a network
server, or a command-line tool, Go is a good language to consider.**
